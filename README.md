# Modified Grey Wolf Optimization


## Features
- You can find GWO_modified_v1.py and GWO_modified_v2.py in EvoloPy/Optimizers directory.
- GWO_modified_v1 is based on the assumption of center bias of GWO.
- GWO_modified_v2 is based on the assumption of origin bias of GWO.
- In modified_v1_GWO, testing results are provided, and it proves to have origin bias.
